# PointApp
Android App to control RaspberryPI servos

It connects to a simple REST service (available here: https://github.com/varkenvarken/Point )

A bit more on these [GitHub pages](https://varkenvarken.github.io/PointApp/)

## Installation
No real installation instructions, haven't put the app in the appstore (and probably never will).

You can clone this directory and test the app in an emulator and then simply connect your real phone
or tablet in developer mode and deploy it.

## Connecting to a https server
Connecting over https to a server with a self-signed certificate is not so straight forward and
documented here https://github.com/varkenvarken/PointApp/blob/master/Doc/NetworkSecurity.md
