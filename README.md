# PointApp
Android App to control RaspberryPI servos

It connects to a simple REST service (available here: https://github.com/varkenvarken/Point )

Connecting over https to a server with a self-signed certificate is not so straight forward and
documented here https://github.com/varkenvarken/PointApp/blob/master/Doc/NetworkSecurity.md
