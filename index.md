## Welcome to PointApp

![Working Point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/varkenvarken/PointApp/gh-pages/pointmovement.webp)

As of April 29 we have a working combination of a RaspberryPi running a [REST server](https://github.com/varkenvarken/Point) and an [Android app](https://github.com/varkenvarken/PointApp) that can control it.

In the image you see a RaspberryPi 3B with a Waveshare servohat (and a Witty Pi 2 programmable power switch in between).
